 * Create a :requires option to each buildable object to establish a 
   dependency chain. In the example of OpenGCD, the chain looks like:

      libdispatch -> libpwq, libkqueue, libBlocksRuntime -> clang toolchain

   The Makefile should be structured so that the running the ./configure 
   scripts is deferred until after their dependency has been built.
